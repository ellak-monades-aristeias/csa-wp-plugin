Open-CSA WordPress Plugin (open-csa-wp) has been designed and implemented in order to provide the functionality required by Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) Teams to operate. The main objective of a CSA Team is to manage a set of product orders from local producers, in weekly basis. To ease this process, open-csa-wp provides a web interface through which user (consumer and producer) accounts, products, delivery spots, and product orders can easily be managed.
